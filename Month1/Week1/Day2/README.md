# Day 2 – Variables, Data Types & Arithmetic

This folder contains `variables_and_operations.py` explaining how to declare Python variables of different data types (int, float, str, bool) and perform arithmetic operations. All code lines have comments, and variable types are checked with `type()`.

**Topics covered:**
- Variable assignment and printing
- Data types: int, float, str, bool
- Arithmetic: addition, division
- AI-generated code prompts

Practice and quiz included at the end. Suitable for absolute beginners!

 
 AI Prompts for Learning & Testing
“Show Python code defining a variable of type int, float, str, and bool and print their types and values.”

“Generate a script to add two exam scores and display the total and average.”

“Explain why Python lets variables change type.”
Answer:- Python lets variables "change type" because variables are just names, not fixed containers.
This makes the language flexible and beginner-friendly, but you need discipline (or type hints) in large systems to avoid surprises.
